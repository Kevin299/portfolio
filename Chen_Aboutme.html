            <p class="fontnew margin margintop"> My name is Kevin Chen and I am a sophomore at Dublin High school. In the future I would like to work in the business industry. After high school I would like to major in a business related topic. The reason I want to go into a business major is because I like doing math, and being able to handle and manage money on a wide scale. I want to be able to promote things and be able to sell something well. To start achieving this goal, I am trying to focus and do well in math. 
            Also I will start to learn the basics to business before I go to college. I am able to promote very well, and be able to do math good too. I think that the business industry aligns with what I like to do and what I can do well.

            <p class="fontnew margin ">In school I have learned many different things. Taking an AP class in my freshman year, I learned how to manage my time throughout the year to study for the AP test. In the tennis team I learned how to work better and communicate with my teammates. Between a lot of homework and a sport I learned to manage my time well. I now know what to prioritize in what I have to do. If you have any questions send me an email found on the contact me page.
