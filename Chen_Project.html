            <h4 >Project: Mit App Inventor</h4>


            <h4>Course: Computer Science Engineering(CSE)</h4>
            <h4>Duration: 3 weeks</h4>
            <h4>Objective: Create an App for a phone</h4>
            <h4>Type of Project: Pairs</h4>
                <p class="col-sm-6 fontsize fontnew">This is the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/" target="_blank">Mit App inventor</a> project that I made with my partner, for the project we were tasked to create an app for a phone.  We were given the rubric and instructions to chose a tutorial from Mit App inventor and improve on it.
                Based on the basic info and code given from the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/quizme.html" target="_blank">tutorial from Mit App</a> we create a basic quiz app. With the basic code done, we started to change things in the app like new features, and more questions. 
                The point of the quiz app was to test one&#8217;s knowledge about the world and random facts. 
                Also we created two different modes, easy and hard, where easy mode is multiple choice and hard mode is you had to type in your answer. Each mode had 20 questions. We added a score to see how well a player would do, and you only have one chance to answer a question.
                In this project I learend how to use Mit App inventor and the basics of creating apps. I learned how to manage time and how to plan out on finishing a long term project. I was able to commuicate better so we could finish the project on time.

            <h4 >Project: Hangman</h4>


            <h4>Course: Computer Science Engineering(CSE)</h4>
            <h4>Duration: 1 weeks</h4>
            <h4>Objective: Create a Hangman Game</h4>
            <h4>Type of Project: Pairs</h4>
                <p class="col-sm-6 fontsize fontnew"> 
                This is the Hangman project that I created with my partner. In this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkMFXtO6bo6KOjcn710zRD2RlkATL90_/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project</a> we were tasked to make a hangman game. 
                At the beginning of the project we created an outline of a basic hangman game. Based on the basic code we added new features and created a theme. 
                The theme we choose was presidents of the United States. Some features we added to the game, were that it showed what letters you have guessed, and also that you can only guess one letter at at time. 
                The number of chances someone gets is based on the length of the word. We had all 43 presidents in the game. We added ascii art to make it more interactive, making it to when you guess incorrectly it would added to the picture.
                In doing this project I learned how to use python better, and how to create a hangman game, using python.
